# Read-more-values-than-ports-Arduino
Using the digital pins on an arduino to read numbers given from a number of buttons in a binary configuration

This project is meant for me to simply learn and experience working with different circuits and it's components. 
The coding is very easy and only meant to show that everything is working.

Pushing the upmost button results in a 1 being the value of the variable btnVal.
Going down the column the value is incremented by 1 each time.

With this setup it can support a total of 7 buttons which aren't included here.

Future goal is to hook up a 7-segment display to show the corresponding value of each button press.
